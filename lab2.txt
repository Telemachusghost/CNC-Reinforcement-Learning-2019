1. Upload a description of the structure of your program the 10-armed bandit testbed.

I just created a class for a bandit which can be initialized with a 
few different values (Left over from Richard's skeleton code) 
I only use the true reward parameter.

I thought this would be a little easier because it seperates concerns a
little by having each bandit be responsible for its estimated reward and
its reward etc.

I then made a SimulateKBandits function that takes in k bandits and 
does the algorithm as detailed in the text. 

This makes the function responsible for the algorithm and the 
bandits responsible for the data attached to them. 

2. upload you description of the similarities and differences between sample average and expected value

sample average and expected value both work with random variables

sample average works with an already existing sample and then takes
its arithmetic mean

expected value is the average value of the same experiment in other 
words it takes into account the probablity of a value appearing and
then averages these values.

So I guess the biggest difference is that sample average works with
a group of existing values and expected value deals with experiments
